                <h4>[04/04/2025] Hard work pays, sometimes</h4>
            </div>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The moment I saw my exam result, I actually had to stare at it for a few
                    seconds to
                    make sure I wasn&rsquo;t imagining things. After all those weeks of grinding, panicking, and
                    convincing
                    myself I was going to fail, seeing that passing grade felt surreal. A seven, handwritten where I
                    expected a
                    number lower than 5. I didn&rsquo;t celebrate right away&mdash;I just sat there, exhausted,
                    relieved, and a
                    little stunned that the thing I&rsquo;d been dreading for weeks was finally over, and I&rsquo;d made
                    it
                    through.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
            <p> &nbsp; </p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">The lead-up was brutal. There were days when I&rsquo;d sit at my desk for
                    hours,
                    flipping through hand notes, vectors, matrices equations, rewriting concepts; only to feel like none
                    of it
                    was sticking. I&#39;d practice questions and get half of them wrong, and that voice in my head would
                    whisper, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not cut out for this&rdquo;. &ldquo;What if you&rsquo;re just wasting
                    your
                    time?&rdquo; I&rsquo;d seen classmates breeze through material that left me stuck, and it made me
                    wonder if
                    I was missing something, if I was somehow falling behind without realizing it.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
            <p> &nbsp; </p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">But I kept going anyway, even when it felt pointless. I stopped trying to
                    memorize
                    everything at once and just focused on one thing at a time. I let myself take breaks without guilt,
                    because
                    I finally accepted that staring at notes for ten hours straight wasn&rsquo;t helping if my brain was
                    fried.
                    And when the exam day came, I walked through the gates, fully expecting to blank every
                    question&mdash;but
                    somehow, the work I&rsquo;d put in carried me through.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
            <p> &nbsp; </p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">And through all of it, there was one person who never let me drown in my own
                    doubts&mdash;my girlfriend. She was the one who brought me coffee at any hour when I was still
                    hunched over
                    my books, who listened to me rant about how impossible it all felt, and who somehow always knew when
                    to push
                    me and when to just hug me and tell me it would be okay. I don&rsquo;t think I could&rsquo;ve kept
                    my sanity
                    through this without her. </span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
            <p> &nbsp; </p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Passing didn&rsquo;t just feel like luck. It felt like proof that even when
                    you&rsquo;re convinced you&rsquo;re doomed, even when every practice test feels like a disaster, you
                    can
                    still surprise yourself&mdash;especially when you have someone in your corner who believes in you
                    more than
                    you believe in yourself. </span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
            <p> &nbsp; </p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">I get it. It&rsquo;s exhausting. But keep going. You might be closer than you
                    think.</span></p>
            <p class="c0"><span class="c1"></span></p>
