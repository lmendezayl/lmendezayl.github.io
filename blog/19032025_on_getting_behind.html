                <h4>[19/03/2025] On getting behind</h4>
            </div>
            <div>
                Hello internet. 
            </div>
            <div> 
                &nbsp;
            </div>
            <div>
                Today it's the first day of my fifth semester at college. But I'm still not proud of whom I've become academically over the past 2 and a half years. 
                According to the quantity of courses I passed, I should be in my third semester, but here I am, embarking in a new chapter, which I fear a lot, truly. 
                The subjects I'm taking these semester are between easy and extremely hard, Advanced Analysis taking the latter title. That subject actually, changed the way I see math.
                But sadly, I am retaking that course, because I failed it last year. Long nights I've cried over that subject; the (not)empowering feeling of dumbness rounding my thoughts, even 
                driving me crazy over the idea of realizing that perhaps this path was not made for me - perhaps choosing data science as my major was not my smartest move.
                But I got over it, shit happens, and will continue to happen. Those times are the ones that makes our mind stronger, someone said sometime. 
            </div>
            <div> 
                &nbsp;
            </div>
            <div>
                However, another feeling grew deeper than that. 
                A feeling that not only involves me, and the way my mind views itself. But a feeling that affects my surroundings, a feeling that everyone else is getting the grip of their life,
                while one's stuck at the starting line. The fear of getting behind in life, in academia; the fear of making short-term-benefit decisions that harm my future; or the idea 
                that taking short spanned detriments is not worth the while; but others do, so you stay in the same place you were years ago.   
            </div>
            <div> 
                &nbsp;
            </div>
            <div>
                The feeling's not new though - truth is, it's always been there, and apparently always will be. Ever since I left high school, the thought of not doing enough - being enough, while others bathe in their hard-working 
                rewards - when in reality, one only sees what others want you to see, will develop this later. 
            </div>
            <div>

                At 18, I started Systems Engineering at UTN, but I was a different Lautaro back then, 
                I felt like college was not worth the while, so I didn't put much effort in. 
            </div>
            <div> 
                &nbsp;
            </div>
            <div> 
                At 19, a brief switch to Computer Science made me realize that it was meant for me - even though I didn't even knew how to code.
                In the meantime, some of my high school ex-colleagues were already in ther sophomore year! I tried not to give it much thought, since my self-esteem was at an all-time low due to breakups, family issues,
                and financial inestability. I really didn't take into account all of those issues: for me, I was just getting behind because of my OWN fault, for knowing how to choose, or not being smart enough.
            </div>
            <div> 
                &nbsp;
            </div>
            <div>
                Anyways, at 20 years old, I met a couple of guys in my Algebra 1 classes (props a Aaron y Kevin, lqm), which made me realize computer science was not meant for me; I had it clear - I now wanted to be a mathematician.
                Naive of me not knowing - that wasn't meant for me either. 
            </div>
            <div> 
                &nbsp;
            </div>
            <div>
                Two and a half weeks deep into the pure math initial classes, Linear Algebra and pre-Advanced Calculus, I realized I wanted to do math, but not <b>that</b> kind of math: I wanted to be an applied math student!
                So I asked another friend, enrolled in Data Science (Tiago), if he could give me a hand trying to figure out the syllabus for Computational Linear Algebra, the subject I would change to if I wanted to 
                give up pure for applied. So I did it. I switched over to Data Science. 
            </div>
            <div> 
                &nbsp;
            </div>
            <div> 
                Up then, I knew that I was getting behind, but it then hit me, at 21 years old. I realized that while I was taking my time trying to understand what I wanted for my future, some were already working,
                some had already graduated from college, even my own girlfriend. Hell, some even lived alone.  Even friends made in college - people with the same initial conditions - were already one or even two semesters ahead of me. 
                While I was stuck switching majors, they were getting ahead
                of everyone else in their lifes. 
                
            </div>
            <div> 
                &nbsp;
            </div>
            <div>
                Perhaps - I think - they just don't doubt themselves, or don't have a breathless sensation everytime they need to make a longlasting decision in their lives. 
                The reality is they do, everyone does. Every soul in this planet, who achieved greatness, has at some point experienced bottom rock.
