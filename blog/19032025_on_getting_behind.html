                <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hello internet.</span></p>
                <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                <p> &nbsp; </p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Today is the first day of my fifth semester at college. But I&#39;m still
                        not proud
                        of who I&#39;ve become academically over the past two and a half years. According to the number
                        of courses
                        I&#39;ve passed, I should be in my third semester&mdash;yet here I am, embarking on a new
                        chapter, one I
                        fear deeply.</span></p>
                <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                <p> &nbsp; </p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c1">The subjects I&#39;m taking this semester range from easy to extremely
                        hard, with
                        Advanced Analysis claiming the title of hardest. That subject alone changed the way I see math.
                        Sadly,
                        I&#39;m retaking it because I failed last year. Long nights were spent crying over it, the
                        crushing weight
                        of inadequacy wrapping around my thoughts, even driving me to question whether this path was
                        meant for
                        me&mdash;whether choosing Data Science as my major was a mistake.</span></p>
                <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                <p> &nbsp; </p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c1">But I got over it. Shit happens, and it will keep happening. They say
                        these moments
                        are what make us stronger.</span></p>
                <p> &nbsp; </p>
                <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Yet another feeling grew deeper than self-doubt&mdash;one that
                        doesn&rsquo;t just
                        affect me, but everything around me. The gnawing sensation that everyone else is moving forward
                        while
                        I&rsquo;m stuck at the starting line. The fear of falling behind in life, in academia. The dread
                        that every
                        short-term decision I make might ruin my future, while others take risks and leap ahead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                <p> &nbsp; </p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c1">This feeling isn&rsquo;t new. It&rsquo;s been here since I left high
                        school&mdash;the
                        constant whisper that I&rsquo;m not doing enough, being enough, while others reap the rewards of
                        their hard
                        work. (Though in reality, we only see what others want us to see&mdash;more on that
                        later.)</span></p>
                <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                <p> &nbsp; </p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c1">At 18, I started Systems Engineering at UTN, but I was a different person
                        back then.
                        I didn&rsquo;t believe in college, so I didn&rsquo;t try.</span></p>
                <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                <p> &nbsp; </p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c1">At 19, a brief switch to Computer Science made me realize coding was for
                        me&mdash;even though I barely knew how to write a single line. Meanwhile, some of my high school
                        classmates
                        were already in their sophomore year. I tried not to dwell on it, but my self-esteem was at rock
                        bottom&mdash;breakups, family issues, financial instability. To me, none of that mattered. I was
                        behind
                        because of my own failures: bad choices, lack of intelligence.</span></p>
                <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                <p> &nbsp; </p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Then, at 20, I met two guys in my Algebra 1 class (shoutout to Aaron y
                        Kevin, lqm).
                        They made me realize Computer Science wasn&rsquo;t my calling&mdash;I wanted to be a
                        mathematician. Naively,
                        I didn&rsquo;t realize that wasn&rsquo;t for me either.</span></p>
                <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                <p> &nbsp; </p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Two and a half weeks into pure math&mdash;Linear Algebra and pre-Advanced
                        Calculus&mdash;I knew I loved math, but not that kind. I wanted applied math. A friend in Data
                        Science
                        (thanks, Tiago) helped me navigate the syllabus for Computational Linear Algebra, the subject
                        I&rsquo;d
                        switch to if I abandoned pure math. So I did. I switched.</span></p>
                <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                <p> &nbsp; </p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c1">By then, I knew I was behind. But it truly hit me at 21. While I was
                        still figuring
                        out what I wanted, some people were already working. Some had graduated. My own girlfriend had.
                        Some even
                        lived on their own. Friends I made in college&mdash;people who started with me&mdash;were now a
                        semester or
                        two ahead. While I was stuck switching majors, they were moving forward with their lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                <p> &nbsp; </p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c1">Maybe they don&rsquo;t doubt themselves. Maybe they don&rsquo;t feel that
                        suffocating
                        pressure every time they make a life-altering decision.</span></p>
                <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                <p> &nbsp; </p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c1">But the truth? They do. Everyone does. Every person who&rsquo;s ever
                        achieved
                        something great has, at some point, hit rock bottom.</span></p>
                <p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                <p> &nbsp; </p>
                <p class="c0"><span class="c1">And here I am&mdash;still climbing.</span></p>
