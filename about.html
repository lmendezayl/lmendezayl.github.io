            <div>
                Hello internet. My name is Lautaro, but go by roguesir or lmendezayl online. I'm 21 years old and an undergrad student for my BSc in Data Science at the University of Buenos Aires, where I'm from; and am now going down the path of machine learning, 
                and in a future (hopefully) become an ML engineer or something nearby. I'm trying to be a small content creator in my free time, but find it hard to edit and produce videos while studying. 
                Future videos could truly be about anything I find interesting, really. Next video I will probably do is about my recent mouse change. 
            </div>
            <h1>interests</h1>
            <h3>mathematics</h3>
            <div>
                My love for math has always been present. My oldest memory of doing something math related goes back to when i had 6 years old, when a member of the family gave me a book called 
                "100 Logical Problems for kids". At the time I didn't gave it much thought to it, hell, I was 6 years old, but I remember coming home and almost every day tring to solve one of the hundred 
                problems in that book. For the next couple of years, math had become something I was so devoted to --that I lost interest in them. I regained it when I was about 17 years old, when the global
                pandemic struck, so I had more time to read about math online, since I hadn't gave it a chance since primary school because I was addicted to another interest: videogames.
            </div>
            <h3>videogames</h3>
            <div>
                It is not my proudest thing to say that I was addicted to videogames during my teenage years, but it was a common thing back then. It all started when 8 year old me received an almost brand new
                Playstation 2 for Christmas Eve. Ever since, I couldn't let them go. Games like Factorio, Cities: Skylines, KSP, Hearts Of Iron, most recently Balatro; I created a sort of cushion of favorite genres in the last few years, discovering that my favorite kind of games
                are those that are slow-paced, perhaps due to my undiagnosed ADHD according to my girlfriend, since I become anxious whenever I'm playing games that are too frenetic. There is an exception tho, which I at times regret 
                getting into, and sometimes don't: League of Legends. That game has utterly ruined my teenage years at time, becoming addicted and dropping 7000 hours of my life to if. Two whole bachelors, if taken into account times of studying. 
                I've been slowly replacing gaming for coding over the last few years, trying to become proficient in Python, and trying to make use of my head for making datasets rather than hitting a whole Aphelios combo. But I don't regret 
                entering videogames, and never will. Lifetime friendships have been made in the span of 10-15 years of playing every single day, and I'd never change that for anything. 
            </div>
            <h3>music</h3>
            Shorter paragraph because I'm getting sleepy, I'm a HUGE progressive rock fan, my latest discoveries are Anekdoten(kinda metal but meh), Porcupine Tree, Camel, and Renaissance. But my all timers are forever Genesis,
            Emerson, Lake & Palmer, and Pink Floyd, although I've heard that some don't consider them prog. Another genre I've explored last year was Japanese Indie and Mandopop. Ichiko Aoba and Kaede where in my top 5 Spotify 
            list, and 万能青年旅店 (Omnipotent Youth Society) too, being the only Mandoprog band I know.
