            <h1>about me</h1>
            <div>
                Hello internet. I'm Lautaro (though online, you'll find me as roguesir or lmendezayl). At 21, I'm a
                third-year Data Science undergrad at the University of Buenos Aires, slowly carving my path toward
                machine learning—with hopes of someday becoming an ML engineer or something adjacent.
                I also dabble in content creation when time allows, though balancing video editing with coursework remains a
                challenge.

            <h2>my interests</h2>
            <h3>mathematics</h3>
            <div>
                My love for math has always been present. My oldest memory of doing something math related goes back to
                when I was 6 years old, when a member of the family gave me a book called
                "100 Logical Problems for kids". At the time I didn't gave it much thought to it, hell, I was 6 years
                old, but I remember coming home and almost every day trying to solve one of the hundred
                problems in that book. Childhood devotion faded into teenage indifference—until the pandemic
                resurrected it. Lockdowns gave me time to rediscover math’s beauty, pulling me back from a years-long
                hiatus spent chasing another obsession.
            </div>
            <p> &nbsp; </p>
            <h3>videogames</h3>
            <div>
                It is not my proudest thing to say that I was addicted to videogames during my teenage years. It began
                with a PlayStation 2 on Christmas Eve at age eight and spiraled into
                thousands of hours lost to League of Legends (two whole bachelors, if taken into account times of studying. Yes, I’m one of those people). But amidst the regret,
                there’s gratitude: slow-burn games like Factorio and Cities: Skylines became comfort food for my
                restless mind (my girlfriend insists I have undiagnosed ADHD), while multiplayer titles forged
                friendships that outlasted my addiction. 
                I've slowly replaced gaming for coding over the last few years, trying to become proficient in Python,
                and trying to make use of my head for making algorithms rather than hitting a whole Aphelios combo. But
                I don't regretentering videogames, and never will.
            </div>
            <p> &nbsp; </p>
            <h3>music</h3>
            <div>
                Progressive rock is my sonic home. Genesis, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, and Pink Floyd (fight me on their
                "prog" status) are eternal favorites, though lately I’ve wandered into darker corners—Anekdoten’s
                metal-tinged soundscapes, Porcupine Tree’s haunting grooves. Another genre I've explored last year was
                Japanese Indie and Mandopop. Ichiko Aoba and Kaede where in my top 5 Spotify list, and 万能青年旅店
                (Omnipotent Youth Society) too, being the only Mandopop/prog band I know.
